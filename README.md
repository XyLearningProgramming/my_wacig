# Writing a compiler in go - My improved version

## What is repo for?

This repo is my version of implementing the compiler of the "monkey" language described in the book "writing a compiler in go" by Thorsten Ball.

It is based on my version of the [first part](https://github.com/XyLearningProgramming/my_writing_an_interpreter_in_go_playground) of the sequel, with tweaks to the monkey language such as the `float` structure, python like array indexing, etc.

## Features (TODO)
